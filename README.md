# Random-forest-country-classifier
This project uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict a country based on city lifestyle data.

Aim: To build and evaluate a Random Forest classification model that predicts a country using numerical features from a city lifestyle dataset.

The data is label-encoded, scaled, split into training and test sets, and evaluated using accuracy, out-of-bag score, and a confusion matrix.
